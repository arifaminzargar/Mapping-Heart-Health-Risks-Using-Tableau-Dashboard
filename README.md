# Mapping-Heart-Health-Risks-Using-Tableau Dashboard

 Understanding Heart Health Risks with Data Insights ❤️📊

Today, I'm excited to share my latest Tableau dashboard that dives deep into heart disease risk factors and highlights key patterns in health metrics. Here are some insights derived from the data:

🔎 Key Findings:

Age Matters: Individuals aged 55-65 are at the highest risk, signaling the importance of proactive heart health awareness for this group.
Gender Disparity: Men show a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to women, reinforcing the need for targeted health campaigns.
Vital Metrics: Elevated resting blood pressure and fasting blood sugar levels stand out as the strongest risk indicators for heart disease, whereas cholesterol and maximum heart rate show less significant differences.
🎯 Why it Matters:
Visualizing health data in this way empowers both individuals and healthcare providers to focus on critical age groups and key risk factors. It's a step forward in using data-driven insights for better healthcare outcomes.
