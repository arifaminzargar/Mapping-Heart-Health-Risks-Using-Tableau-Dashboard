Understanding Heart Health Risks with Data Insights ❤️📊

I'm excited to share my latest Tableau dashboard story that dives deep into heart disease risk factors and highlights key patterns in health metrics. Here are some insights derived from the data:

🔎 Key Findings:

Age Matters: Individuals aged 55-65 are at the highest risk, signaling the importance of proactive heart health awareness for this group.
Gender Disparity: Men show a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to women, reinforcing the need for targeted health campaigns.
Vital Metrics: Fasting blood sugar shows a significant difference between groups(Heart Disease Vs. Normal), making it a key indicator. The heart disease group has a lower Maximum Heart Rate(Max HR) and slightly higher Resting BP, aligning with common symptoms, while elevated cholesterol may not always indicate heart conditions.
